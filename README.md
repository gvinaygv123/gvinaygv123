# Hi, I’m G Vinay 👋

## 💫 About Me
I’m an entry-level **Data Scientist and Data Analyst** with hands-on experience transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support business decision-making. I work across the full data lifecycle—from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to building machine learning models and creating interactive dashboards.

I have strong practical skills in **Python, SQL, Power BI, Machine Learning, and Streamlit**, and I enjoy solving real-world problems using data. Through internships and projects, I’ve analyzed large datasets, built predictive models, and developed KPI-driven dashboards to uncover trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities.

I’m particularly interested in **data analytics, predictive modeling, and business intelligence**, and I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable stories. I’m always eager to learn, strengthen my technical depth, and contribute meaningfully to data-driven teams.
